- When the prolog interpreter is executed, it assumes a “working directory”: it will look for files only in the current working directory.
    - To discover the current working dir: “pwd.”
    - **To change working dir**: “working_directory(Old, New).”
        - imposta la directory di lavoro corrente a New
        - restituisce nella variabile Old la directory corrente prima del cambio 
            - utile se si vuole tornare indietro: working_directory(_, Old)
            
- Programs must be loaded, through the pre-processing of source files
    - Given a file “test.pl”, it can be **loaded** through “consult(test).”
- When a program source is modified, it needs to be reloaded into the database clause
    - Command “make.” **reloads all the changed files** 
    - It is always a good practice to close the interpreter, and run it again, from time to time…
